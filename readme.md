Proof-of-concept of Bomberman in UE4.

The current version of this project uses engine version 4.17.

This project uses the UE4 starter content. After cloning please locate the starter content and copy it into the project's content folder, 
as the assets have been left out to reduce the version control load.
The content can be found under "Samples/StarterContent" in any installation of UE. Usually, the path is "Program Files/Epic Games/UE_X.XX/Samples/StarterContent".

The time spent on this project was around 17-18 hours.
